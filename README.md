# Deep-Deterministic-Policy-Gradient
Implementing the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm with the help of neural function approximators.
Solving the “Pendulum-v0” problem. Pendulum is a rather basic environment and would take no more than 300 episodes to reach a well-performing policy.
Solving the “HalfCheetah” locomotion task in MuJoCo. HalfCheetah is a more challenging environment than Pendulum, it would take a bit more training time to reach a well-performing policy, say reaching a score of 4000 within 300k training steps or so.
